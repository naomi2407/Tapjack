# Tapjack
Imagine seeing  a dozen images flash by in a fraction of a second. Would you be able to identify any number of them?

In this interactive experiment, a game of ‘Tapjack’ tests out the theory that the brain can actually process images shown for as little as 13 milliseconds at a time. Participants are broken up into two teams of 10 each.  A common, large screen will display a master image while each team uses 10 wall-mounted mobile screens.  As you look at the mobile screens on the wall, you will see different images flashing through them, some associated with the master image and some purely random. The task is a race to the finish line where participants need to identify all the flashing images that are associated with the master image to complete the experiment, but under a timer. 

The master image and associated flashing images will be tied together in a theme that  will only be revealed on the day of the exhibit.
