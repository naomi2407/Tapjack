# Tapjack
Imagine seeing  a dozen images flash by in a fraction of a second. Would you be able to identify any number of them?

In this interactive experiment, a game of ‘Tapjack’ tests out your image association skills. Participants are broken up into two teams of 10 each. A common, large master image will be displayed, while each team uses 10 wall-mounted mobile screens.  As you look at the mobile screens on the wall, you will see different images flashing through them, some associated with the master image and some purely random. The task is a race to the finish line where participants need to identify all the flashing images that are associated with the master image to complete the experiment, but under a timer. 

How it works:
1: The participants are broken up into two teams of 10 each. Each team is assigned their console, which consists of 10 wall-mounted mobile screens, one for each participant. A common screen displays a ‘master image’, and that kicks off your challenge. 

2: A number of different, random, and some ‘not so random’ images will start flashing at 13-80 millisecond intervals. 

3: Similar to a relay race, each participant needs to take turns to run up to the console, quickly identify one image that corresponds to the master image, and tap on the screen of that image to get it to freeze. All this needs to be processed in a flash of a second. 1 down, 9 more to go! As soon as you are done, you run back to your team and another team member runs up to the console after you. 

4. The game ends with whichever team manages to complete the 10 screens correctly under the shortest amount of time.
